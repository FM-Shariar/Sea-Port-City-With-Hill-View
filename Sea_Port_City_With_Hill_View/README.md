Project Introduction: <br>
This is a computer graphics project named "Seaside Haven: A Sea Port with Hill View," which 
pictures a lively seaport surrounded by scenic hills. Here you can watch cargo ships sail gracefully, 
enjoy the sun and moon rise and set and see stars twinkle at night. The scene includes a busy road, 
moving vehicles, vibrant trees, a working windmill, a port with cranes lifting containers, roadside 
lampposts etc. You can interact with day-to-night transitions, rain or snowfall, and keyboard and 
mouse-controlled features. Finally, the animation of basic human figures added a touch of realism. <br>
